# Overview

CineLog is a streamlined web application tailored for movie and series fans to track and organize their viewing preferences. Built with React, Vite, Express, PostgreSQL, and TypeScript, it delivers a fast and intuitive experience. Users can create lists to categorize titles as watched, want to watch, currently watching, dropped, or on hold. The app starts with a clean landing page featuring a "Start List" button, where users enter a username to create a dedicated table in the PostgreSQL database. No authentication system is used; re-entering the same username grants access to their data. CineLog includes three main pages: a search page for finding titles, a lists page displaying all user-created lists with options to view or edit them, and a profile page showcasing stats, activity visuals, and a profile picture upload feature. The core of CineLog is its polished list management, enhanced by a customized Shadcn UI with a unique color scheme. Lists offer grid or list view toggles, filtering options, quick-add functionality, an edit menu for updating status or TV show seasons, a 10-point rating system, and easy deletion of lists or items. CineLog prioritizes a seamless UI/UX, making it an ideal tool for managing your cinematic journey.

## Feature/Component Descriptions

| **Feature / Component**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                  | **Priority** | **Page / Scope**            |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| âœ… **Landing Page**              | The landing page should have a prominent "Start List" button. When clicked, it prompts the user to enter a username, which is then stored in `localStorage` for session persistence. This action either creates a new user table in the database or fetches an existing table based on the username provided. It serves as the entry point for the app.                     | ðŸ”´ High      | `LandingPage.tsx`           |
| âœ… **Username-based Session**    | The app uses `localStorage` to store the username, ensuring that a user's session persists even when they refresh the page. It eliminates the need for a traditional authentication system, and the app dynamically loads the corresponding data and lists based on the saved username from `localStorage`. This system works globally throughout the app.                                                                   | ðŸ”´ High      | App-wide                    |
| âœ… **Backend User Handling**     | A set of API routes that handle user-related operations, such as creating and fetching the user's table based on the username. This ensures that the data for each user is stored separately and can be retrieved or updated efficiently. The API will interact with a PostgreSQL database, using SQL queries to manage user-specific data such as lists, ratings, and statuses.                                                                  | ðŸ”´ High      | Express + PostgreSQL        |

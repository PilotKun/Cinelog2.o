# Best Practices for React + Vite + Express + PostgreSQL + TypeScript Projects

## 🔧 1. Project Structure & Separation of Concerns

- Use a monorepo or clearly separate `/client` (React + Vite) and `/server` (Express + PostgreSQL) directories.
- Use a `/shared` directory for shared TypeScript types/interfaces.
- Keep concerns separate: routing, business logic, database access, and utility functions should be modular.

---

## 📦 2. Environment Management

- Use `.env` files for managing environment variables (`.env.development`, `.env.production`, etc.).
- Use a package like `dotenv` in Express and `import.meta.env` in Vite.
- **Never commit** your `.env` file to version control — use `.gitignore`.

---

## ✅ 3. TypeScript Practices

- Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json` (`"strict": true`) for better type safety.
- Define interfaces or types for all major data structures.
- Avoid using `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- Use enums or union types to restrict possible values.

---

## ⚛️ 4. React (with Vite)

- Structure components into `components/`, `pages/`, `hooks/`, and `utils/`.
- Use **React Query** or **SWR** for data fetching to simplify async logic and caching.
- Use `useEffect` and `useState` carefully to avoid unnecessary re-renders or race conditions.
- Use Vite plugins like `vite-tsconfig-paths` for cleaner imports.

---

## 🌐 5. Express Backend

- Use `express.Router()` to modularize API endpoints.
- Validate input with libraries like `zod` or `joi`.
- Use `async/await` and proper `try/catch` blocks for all async routes.
- Separate routes, controllers, and services for better code organization.

---

## 🗃️ 6. PostgreSQL with TypeScript

- Use an ORM like **Drizzle**, **Prisma**, or **TypeORM** for type-safe database access.
- Write clear migration scripts and version control them (`migrations/` folder).
- Normalize schema and use constraints to ensure data integrity.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection (handled by most ORMs by default).

---

## 🧪 7. Testing

- Use **Jest** or **Vitest** for unit testing.
- Use **Supertest** to test Express endpoints.
- Add integration tests for critical backend logic (e.g. DB interactions).
- Use tools like **React Testing Library** for testing React components.

---

## 🧰 8. Dev & Build Tooling

- Linting: Use **ESLint** with TypeScript and React plugins.
- Formatting: Use **Prettier** with a shared config (`.prettierrc`).
- Use **Husky** + **lint-staged** to run checks before commits.
- Use **nodemon** for backend development and `vite`'s hot reload for frontend.

---

## 🔐 9. Security & Error Handling

- Sanitize and validate user inputs.
- Use centralized error handling middleware in Express.
- Avoid exposing sensitive info in frontend.
- Use HTTPS and CSRF protection if applicable.

---

## 🚀 10. Deployment Readiness

- Bundle frontend and serve via Express or use separate hosting for frontend (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
- Set up logging and monitoring for backend.
- Use environment-based configuration switching.
- Automate deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions or similar tools.

---

## 🧹 11. Code Quality and Maintenance

- Keep your code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).
- Use meaningful commit messages.
- Document functions and modules where necessary.
- Use a consistent naming convention across frontend and backend.

---

## ✅ Final Notes

- Break down large features into small, testable units.
- Start with MVP features, then iterate.
- Regularly test the integration between backend and frontend.
- Continuously refactor code as the project grows.
